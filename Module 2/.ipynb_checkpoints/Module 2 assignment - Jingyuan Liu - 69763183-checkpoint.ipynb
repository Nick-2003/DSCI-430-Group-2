    "In class, we discussed different sources of bias that can affect the data we want to use for our Data Science applications. Here is a summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Historical bias\n",
    "**Historical bias:** bias that exists in society and is reflected in the data. It is the most insidious because it arises even if we are able to perfectly sample from the existing population. Most often, it affects groups that are historically disadvantaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. In 2018, 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were women. Historically, women have less frequently made it to a CEO position. A classifier trained to predict the best choice for a new CEO may learn this pattern and determine that being a woman makes one less qualified to be a CEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Representation bias\n",
    "**Representation bias:** the sample underrepresents part(s) of the population and fails to generalize well. This may happen for different reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sampling methods only reached a portion of the population. E.g. Data collected via smartphone apps can under-represent lower incomes or older groups, who may be less likely to own smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The population of interest has changed or is distinct from the sample used during model training. E.g. Data that is representative of Vancouver may not be representative if used to analyze the population in Toronto. Similarly, data representative of Vancouver 100 years ago may not reflect today's population. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Measurement bias\n",
    "**Measurement bias:** it occurs when choosing features that fail to correctly represent the problem, or when there are issues with the data collection. Fore example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The measurement processes varies across groups. E.g. one group of workers is monitored more closely and thus more errors are observed in that group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The quality of data varies across groups. E.g. women often self-report less pain than men and are therefore less likely to receive certain diagnoses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The defined classification task or one of the features used is an oversimplification. E.g. We are designing a model to predict whether a student will be successful in college. We choose to predict the final GPA as metric of success. This, however, ignores other indicators of success."

    "Consider a crowd-sourcing project called [Street Bump](https://www.boston.gov/transportation/street-bump) aimed at helping improve neighbourhood streets in Boston from 2011 to 2014. Volunteers used a smartphone app, which captured GPS location and reported back to the city everytime the driver hit a pothole.

    "There is a risk of representation bias, as the data will likely under-represent lower-income or older groups that are less likely to have smartphones, on top of the population of people that would be interested in volunteering potentially not being representative of the overall population. \n",
    "<br><br>There is also a risk of measurement bias, as road quality is determined by more attributes than potholes alone, such as effective drainage and traffic management. The frequency of drivers hitting potholes is also determined by other factors, such as the proficiency of the drivers themselves, or the location of the potholes.

    "- **Observational study:** study where there is no deliberate human intervention regarding the variable under investigation. Observational studies are ones where researchers observe the effect of a treatment/intervention without trying to change who is or isn’t exposed to it. In an observational study, the subjects are assigned or assign themselves to the exposure group they belong to.\n",

In an experiment, subjects are assigned to a condition by the researcher and thus one can establish a cause-and-effect relationship when we see a difference in the outcome between the experimental groups.

There is no statistic provided to indicate that the difference in button clicks is statistically significant enough to reject the null hypothesis that the number of clicks for both websites is the same. More importantly, as the test was conducted in two different periods, there might be some other variables that could potentially influence the results also changing over time (i.e. users' mood, seasonal effect, etc). The data we collected for each version of the website may also be representative of different populations due to the difference in time frames, leading to representation bias.

    "Ethical A/B testing still requires all the ethical considerations of any experimental study, such as informed consent or possibility to opt out. A notorious case of a company failing to meet ethics requirement in A/B testing is the infamous Facebook \"social contagion experiment\", in which almost 700,000 users were showed, for a week, only positive or only negative content, to see how this variation impacted their online behaviour. The selected users were not informed and could not opt out. Furthermore, their emotional state was affected. Facebook defended itself by saying that Facebook's Data Use Policy warns users that Facebook “may use the information we receive about you…for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement”. This defense was largely rejected by the scientific community, which still considered the study as unethical.

For example, postal code and date of birth are often indirect identifiers, because it is very likely that within a zip code only one individual has this particular birth date.

    "### Pseudonymization\n",
    "\n",
    "A big issue with suppression of direct identifier is that it is not reversible. If at some point we need to identify an individual in our dataset, we would be out of luck. If you have reasons to believe that re-identification may be required, pseudonymization would be a better option to handle direct identifiers. Pseudonymization replaces one or more direct identifiers with a unique but less meaningful value. Usually when we pseudonymize an identifier, there is a possibility of re-identification if required (but it would not be available to the general public).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 10:** pseudomyze the ID column of the NIJ training set and save the result in a new dataframe called `pseudo_df`. In a different code cell, show that it is possible to re-identify the samples by converting them back to the original ID number.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to achieve this you may want to explore:\n",
    "- Write your own pseudonymization function. You should write at least 2 functions: one to pseudomyze, and another to re-identify. The function does not have to be exceedingly complex but it should not be obvious either (e.g. only basic arithmetic involved).\n",
    "- Use an extisting library, such as [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)."
