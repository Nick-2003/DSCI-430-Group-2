    "### Assignment overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is composed of three parts:\n",
    "- **Part 1 - The Black Mirror Writers' Room.** In this portion of the exercise, you will brainstorm near future technology and its possible drawbacks, and illustrate them in a futuristic cautionary tale. You will also be asked questions about ethical theories and how they apply to the scenario you have described. Credits: [Casey Fiesler - The Black Mirror Writers Room: The Case (and Caution) for Ethical Speculation in CS Education](https://medium.com/cuinfoscience/the-black-mirror-writers-room-the-case-and-caution-for-ethical-speculation-in-cs-education-5c81d05d2c67)\n",
    "- **Part 2 - Python review.** As this course uses Python as the programming language for our exercises, a basic understanding of the fundamentals and the use of some libraries is necessary. This portion of the exercise will help you review useful Python syntax and/or fill the gap in your knowledge before tackling larger exercises. We recommend discussing with an instructor if you find this portion of the assignment too difficult to complete with a reasonable amount of effort.\n",
    "- **Part 3 - Final thoughts.** Complete this section so that we can better understand how you completed the assignment and any issues you may have encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, it is possible to work in **groups of up to 2 students**. Read the instructions carefully, as they may assign tasks to specific students.\n",

    "### Group members\n",
    "Leave Student 2 blank if group has less than 2 members:\n",

    "- Student 2: Nicholas Tam 45695970\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this week's lecture and tutorial work, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Define ethics and describe what constitutes an ethical issue \n",
    "2. Explain the need for ethics in data science  \n",
    "3. Identify common ethical issues in data science  \n",
    "4. Describe common ethical frameworks and how they can be applied to data science applications \n",
    "5. Imagine scenarios in which current technology could be used in unethical ways \n",
    "6. Evaluate and make arguments around data science scenarios using ethical theories (e.g., Kantianism, utilitarianism, virtue ethics etc.)  \n",
    "7. Compare and contrast different ethical theories and explain the case for and against each one as they apply to data science\n",

    "## Warm up\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into the creative writing part, we should review the various elements of FATE in Data Science and make sure that they are clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "| FATE element    | Definition |\n",
    "| :-------- | :------- |\n",
    "| **Fairness**  | The idea that every group or population that is affected by a technological application is being treated equally and not receiving a different outcome *solely because they belong to their group*.   |\n",
    "| **Accountability** | Clear definition of who should be held responsible of the outcome of the technological application and under what circumstances. |\n",
    "| **Transparency** | The technical definition of transparency in Data Science refers to being able to understand why a technological application produced a specific outcome. This is also called *explainability*. But transparency can also refer to the demand of making the use of algorithms more transparent to the public, including informing the users about when they are used, where the data used was sourced from, and making algorithms available for auditing.|\n",
    "| **Ethics** | Evaluation of whether or not a technology should be used based on the moral values of a group or society. Society may reject a technology because it is does not follow the principles of Fairness, Accountability or Transparency, but also for other reasons.|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the country of Dataland, the police department uses an algorithm to assess the risk level of people reporting cases of domestic abuses and violence. Thanks to this algorithm, they can identify the most serious threats and intervene accordingly. The algorithm has had a positive impact, assessing cases with more accuracy than other prior strategies and allowing the police force to make an efficient use of their resources. However, it occasionally fails to correctly identify people at high risk of violence (*false negatives*), leaving them without the protection they need. It is also affected by other issues. For each issue outlined in this table, check whether it is a Fairness, Accountability or Transparency problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue    | Fairness | Accountability | Transparency |\n",
    "| :-------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |\n",
    "| When the algorithm fails to identify a high-risk case and violence occurs, it is unclear if the police department should shoulder any responsibility. |        |        |        | \n",
    "| An analysis of the algorithm's results suggests that false negatives occur more frequently among victims with physical disabilities. |        |        |        | \n",
    "| The majority of people reporting domestic abuse are not aware that their cases are being evaluated by an algorithm, or do not know the score they received. |        |        |        | \n",
    "| The police department receives a recommendation for each case, but does not know which characteristic(s) of the case have resulted in the final evaluation. |        |        |        | \n",
    "| The algorithm was trained using past cases filed by the police department, but the people involved where not informed that their information was being used for this purpose. |        |        |        | \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Considere the issues outlined in the previous question, as well as the fact that the algorithm is the best system of appraisal available to the police forces so far for cases of domestic violence. Do you think that the use of this algorithm is *ethical*? Clearly state your thesis (opposed/favourable) and use one of the ethical perspectives listed in [this reading](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-lenses/) to support it.\n"
