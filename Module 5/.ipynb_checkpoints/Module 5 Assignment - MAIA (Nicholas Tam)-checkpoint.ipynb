    "# Module 5 - Bias in Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be asked to evaluate gender bias in word embeddings, debias the embeddings in post-processing, and determine the extent to which the bias is still present after debiasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is modeled after â€œLipstick on a Pig: Debiasing Methods Cover up Systematic Gender Biases in Word Embeddings But do not Remove Them, by Hila Gonen and Yoav Goldberg (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03862.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, it is possible to work in **groups of up to 2 students**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Group members\n",
    "Leave blanks if group has less than 2 members:\n",
    "- Student 1: Jingyuan Liu (S.N. 69763183)\n",
    "- Student 2: Nicholas Tam (S.N. 45695970)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Evaluate the extent of language bias in word embeddings (pre-trained or trained on a new corpus of text) \n",
    "2. Apply a post-processing approach to reduce the presence of stereotypes in word embeddings; recognize and explain their limitations \n",
    "3. Evaluate the presence of bias in word embeddings after the application of de-biasing strategies \n"

    "\n",
    "Natural language processing, or NLP for short, is the study of how to use computers in order to process, analyze, and produce language similar to how a human would. You've come across NLP if you've used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Google Translate\n",
    "- Speech to text tools\n",
    "- And of course, ChatGPT...\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is: how do we go from words in a language to something a computer can understand? One of the answers is word embeddings. Word embeddings are a way to represent a word using a vector of numbers, in a way such that similar words will have vectors that are closer to each other. For example, when we convert the word \"bad\" into a word embedding, we would expect it to be close to the embedding for \"worst\", but maybe not as close to the word \"rainbow\".\n",

    "There are many different pre-trained word embeddings out there, trained on different kinds of data. In this module we will use pre-trained embeddings (no need to create our own). Before we do that, let's get some more familiarity with vectors and their operations..."

A vector is a type of data that has a magnitude and direction. Vectors can exist in spaces of any dimension. For example, $\\vec{[1, 2]}$ is a vector in 2D space, and $\\vec{[4, 1, 7]}$ is a vector in 3D space. Let's work in 2D space, to make it easier to visualize. "

    "    - Under Direct Chat, pick a model (it can be a random choice) and enter 2-3 prompts, each time changing the question to include a different population (like we saw in the lightbulb jokes example). Compare the answers: can you observe differences caused by the changes introduced in the question?\n",
